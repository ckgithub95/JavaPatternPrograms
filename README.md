# JavaPatternPrograms
JavaPatternPrograms is a collection of Java pattern programs, including star, number, alphabet, pyramid, diamond, Floyd’s Triangle, and Pascal’s Triangle patterns. Ideal for beginners and developers to practice loops and logic in Java. Contributions welcome!

# Pattern Printing Program

This project prints various patterns such as squares, triangles, and inverted triangles using stars, numbers, and a combination of both.

## Files

- **Pattern.java**: Contains all the pattern-generating functions.
- **Main.java**: Contains the main function to execute the program and call functions from `Pattern.java`.
- **PatternTest.java**: Unit tests for the pattern functions using JUnit.

## How to Run

### Compile and run the program:
1. Navigate to the directory containing the Java files.
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java Pattern.java

Running the Unit Tests:
Ensure that JUnit is installed and available in your classpath. You can run the tests using the following steps:

Compile the tests:
javac -cp .:junit-5.7.0.jar PatternTest.java

Run the tests:
java -cp .:junit-5.7.0.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore PatternTest
